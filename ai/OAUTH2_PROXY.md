# oauth2-proxy — Google group gating in front of Open WebUI

Sits between Cloudflare and Open WebUI. Every request to `chat.zeoenergy.com` must pass a Google sign-in AND belong to a specific Google Workspace group before it can reach Open WebUI. Access is controlled from **Google Admin console → Directory → Groups** — add or remove a user from the group to grant or revoke.

## Traffic flow

```
Browser  →  Cloudflare (TLS)  →  cloudflared tunnel  →  oauth2-proxy:4180  →  openwebui:8080
                                                             ↓
                                                       Google OAuth
                                                             +
                                                    Google Directory API
                                                    (group membership check)
```

### Quick start

```bash
make up-oauth2-proxy
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
docker compose -f ai/docker-compose.oauth2-proxy.yml --env-file .env -p ai-oauth2-proxy up -d
```

| Container | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `oauth2-proxy` | `localhost:4180` (`PORT_OAUTH2_PROXY`) → container `4180` | Google login + group membership check; proxies to `openwebui:8080` on the `ai_shared` network |

Cloudflare's tunnel reaches oauth2-proxy via the docker host IP on port 4180 (published). Reachable over the `ai_shared` docker network at `http://oauth2-proxy:4180` as well.

---

## Access control

- **Grant access:** add the user to `zeoai.access@zeoenergy.com` in Google Admin → Directory → Groups.
- **Revoke access:** remove them. The change propagates on the next cookie refresh (default: every 15 minutes; hard expiry at 1 hour). To shorten, edit `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_REFRESH` in the compose file.

Suspending the user's entire Google account in Admin console also blocks them (Google OAuth refuses to issue a token), but breaks all their Google access, not just Open WebUI.

---

## One-time Google Cloud setup

### 1. OAuth 2.0 client

The existing OAuth client used by Open WebUI is reused. It needs one additional authorized redirect URI:

```
https://chat.zeoenergy.com/oauth2/callback
```

Add it at: [Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → click the OAuth 2.0 Client ID → **Authorized redirect URIs** → **+ Add URI** → paste → **Save**.

The existing OpenWebUI redirect URI (`.../oauth/google/callback`) stays; you are only appending.

### 2. Service account (for group membership lookups)

oauth2-proxy queries Google's Directory API to check whether the signed-in user is in the allowed group. That call is authenticated by a service account with **domain-wide delegation**.

1. Google Cloud Console → **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts** → **Create service account**.
   - Name: `oauth2-proxy-groups` (or similar).
   - Skip the "grant access to project" step.
2. On the created service account → **Keys** tab → **Add key → Create new key → JSON**. The JSON downloads to your machine.
3. Rename the file to `sa-key.json` and place it on the docker host at:
   ```
   ai/oauth2-proxy/sa-key.json
   ```
   The compose file mounts this path into the container. **Do not commit this file** — it is a credential.
4. On the same service account → **Details** tab → copy the **Unique ID** (a long numeric string). You need it for domain-wide delegation, below.

---

## One-time Google Admin console setup

Everything below requires super-admin on the Google Workspace tenant that contains `zeoenergy.com`. Both `gosunergy.com` and `zeoenergy.com` are on the same tenant, so `admin@gosunergy.com` is authoritative for both domains.

### 1. Domain-wide delegation

1. [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/) → **Security → Access and data control → API controls**.
2. Scroll to the bottom → **Manage Domain-wide Delegation**.
3. **Add new**:
   - **Client ID:** the numeric Unique ID from the service account.
   - **OAuth scopes:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`
4. **Authorize**.

This grants the service account read-only access to group membership across the Workspace, on behalf of the admin user it impersonates (see `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_ADMIN_EMAIL` below).

### 2. Access group

1. Google Admin console → **Directory → Groups** → confirm `zeoai.access@zeoenergy.com` exists.
2. If creating fresh: **Access type** should be at least **Team** so the service account can enumerate members.
3. Add the users who should have access to Open WebUI.

## Configuration reference

Every value is sourced from the root `.env` — edit there, never in the compose file. The `PORT_OAUTH2_PROXY` slot in the port registry reserves `4180` even though it is not published to the host (cloudflared reaches oauth2-proxy over the `ai_shared` Docker network by service name).

| Compose env var | `.env` key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER` | `google` | OAuth provider — only google is exercised here |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0:4180` | Listener inside the container. Port must equal `PORT_OAUTH2_PROXY` |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_REVERSE_PROXY` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_REVERSE_PROXY` | `true` | Trusts `X-Forwarded-*` headers from cloudflared |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_PASS_USER_HEADERS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_PASS_USER_HEADERS` | `true` | Forwards `X-Forwarded-Email` / `X-Forwarded-User` to Open WebUI |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_SET_XAUTHREQUEST` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_SET_XAUTHREQUEST` | `true` | Also emits `X-Auth-Request-*` headers |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID` | `OPENWEBUI_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | _(reused)_ | Reused from Open WebUI's Google OAuth 2.0 client |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET` | `OPENWEBUI_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(reused)_ | Same client's secret |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET` | _(generate)_ | 32-byte URL-safe base64. Signs session cookies. See generator snippet in `.env.example` |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_DOMAINS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_DOMAINS` | `chat.zeoenergy.com` | Cookie is only sent to this hostname |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_EXPIRE` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_EXPIRE` | `1h` | Hard session lifetime |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_REFRESH` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_REFRESH` | `15m` | Re-check group membership at this interval within a session |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS` | `http://openwebui:8080` | Where to proxy authenticated requests. Docker service DNS, not localhost |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL` | `https://chat.zeoenergy.com/oauth2/callback` | Must match the URI added to the Google OAuth client |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_WHITELIST_DOMAINS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_WHITELIST_DOMAINS` | `chat.zeoenergy.com` | Allowed post-login redirect targets |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | `zeoenergy.com` | Rejects any sign-in outside this domain before the group check |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_GROUPS` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_GROUPS` | `zeoai.access@zeoenergy.com` | User must belong to this group |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@gosunergy.com` | Workspace admin the service account impersonates to read group members |
| `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | `/etc/oauth2-proxy/sa-key.json` | Path **inside the container**; host file is bind-mounted from `ai/oauth2-proxy/sa-key.json` |

## Cloudflare tunnel routing

**First figure out which flavor of tunnel is actually serving `chat.zeoenergy.com`, then edit the right place.** Cloudflare tunnels come in two flavors and they are edited in completely different places — mixing them up is the single most common failure mode of this setup.

| Flavor | Where the config lives | How you edit it |
|---|---|---|
| **Locally-managed** | `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml` on the host (paired with a `credentials-file` JSON in `~/.cloudflared/`) | Edit the file, then `sudo systemctl restart cloudflared` (or the docker restart, if bind-mounted). Dashboard shows a read-only view — edits there are ignored |
| **Remotely-managed** | Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard | Dashboard → tunnel → Public Hostnames. Cloudflared uses a `TUNNEL_TOKEN` and pulls config from the edge |

Identify which one is live on your host:

```bash
ps aux | grep -i cloudflared | grep -v grep
systemctl status cloudflared 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

- If a **systemd** `cloudflared.service` is `active (running)`, that's a **locally-managed** tunnel — the config file wins. Edit `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`.
- If only a **docker container** (e.g. `ai-cloudflared`) is running and it was launched with `TUNNEL_TOKEN`, that's **remotely-managed**. Edit in the dashboard.
- If both are running, you have two tunnels and only one is actually receiving traffic for the hostname. Cloudflare DNS decides which — the tunnel whose UUID appears in the `chat.zeoenergy.com` CNAME record is the live one. The other tunnel's config changes have zero effect.

### Locally-managed edit

```yaml
# /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: <tunnel-uuid>
credentials-file: /home/<user>/.cloudflared/<tunnel-uuid>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: chat.zeoenergy.com
    service: http://localhost:4180     # was http://localhost:8007 pre-oauth2-proxy
  - service: http_status:404
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

### Remotely-managed edit

1. [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Networks → Tunnels**.
2. Click the tunnel that routes `chat.zeoenergy.com` → **Edit** → **Public Hostnames**.
3. Edit the row for `chat.zeoenergy.com`. Change **Service** to:
   - `http://<host-ip>:4180` (oauth2-proxy's published host port), or
   - `http://oauth2-proxy:4180` if cloudflared runs in a container on the `ai_shared` docker network.
4. **Save**.

### Verify traffic is actually flowing through oauth2-proxy

Regardless of tunnel flavor, run this end-to-end check from any machine:

```bash
curl -sfL https://chat.zeoenergy.com/oauth2/ping && echo " → PASS" || echo " → FAIL"
```

Expected: `OK → PASS`. If it returns HTML or a redirect to `/oauth/google/login`, cloudflared is routing straight to Open WebUI and the group check is being bypassed.

---

## Double-login note

Open WebUI still has its own Google OAuth login enabled. After passing the oauth2-proxy gate at Cloudflare's edge, the user then sees Open WebUI's own Google login screen and signs in a second time with the same account. Same identity, one extra click.

If a single-sign-on experience is desired, Open WebUI can be switched to trusted-header auth (`WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER=X-Forwarded-Email` etc.) so it accepts the identity that oauth2-proxy has already verified. That change is deliberately not made here — it removes Open WebUI's independent auth layer, and requires guaranteeing that Open WebUI is unreachable except through the proxy.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `oauth2-proxy` container exits immediately | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET` is missing or not 32 bytes of URL-safe base64. Regenerate |
| Redirect to Google, then `redirect_uri_mismatch` error | The Google OAuth client is missing `https://chat.zeoenergy.com/oauth2/callback` in Authorized redirect URIs |
| Sign-in succeeds but 403 "You do not have access" from oauth2-proxy | The user is not in `zeoai.access@zeoenergy.com`, OR domain-wide delegation is misconfigured, OR the impersonated admin email doesn't exist on the tenant |
| oauth2-proxy logs `googleapi: Error 403: Not Authorized` | Domain-wide delegation missing the `admin.directory.group.readonly` scope, or admin email is not a Workspace admin |
| oauth2-proxy logs `unable to read service account key` | `sa-key.json` is missing from `ai/oauth2-proxy/` on the host, or the JSON is malformed |
| oauth2-proxy logs `Admin SDK API has not been used in project <id> before or it is disabled` (403) | The Google Cloud project owning the OAuth client + service account doesn't have the Admin SDK API enabled. Enable at `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/admin.googleapis.com/overview?project=<project-id>` — activation takes ~1 minute to propagate |
| Users still hit Open WebUI directly, bypassing the proxy | Cloudflare tunnel is still routing `chat.zeoenergy.com` to `openwebui:8080` — update the tunnel's public hostname service URL |
| Revocation not taking effect | `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_REFRESH` interval hasn't elapsed. Reduce it, or have the user clear cookies for `chat.zeoenergy.com` |

### Useful commands

```bash
# Follow oauth2-proxy logs
make logs-oauth2-proxy

# Restart after config change
make clean-oauth2-proxy && make up-oauth2-proxy

# Verify the container can reach Open WebUI over the shared network
docker exec oauth2-proxy wget -qO- http://openwebui:8080/health
```

## What NOT to commit

- `ai/oauth2-proxy/sa-key.json` — service account private key
- `.env` values for `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET`, `OPENWEBUI_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Both should be in `.gitignore` already.
