"""Background job worker and in-memory job queue.

The classifier uses an async job pattern so that POST /assess and
POST /assess/compare can return a job ID immediately (202 Accepted) without
blocking the HTTP connection for the full duration of the LLM call.

How it works:
  1. main.py enqueues a tuple (job_id, type, data, request_id) into job_queue.
  2. job_worker() runs as a long-lived asyncio task (started at app startup).
  3. The worker pulls jobs one at a time, calls the appropriate runner, and
     persists the result (or error) to the SQLite store via store.update_job().
  4. Callers poll GET /jobs/{job_id} until status is "completed" or "failed".

Two job runners:
  _run_assess()   — single-image assessment via analysis.analyze_bgr().
  _run_compare()  — multi-example comparison via analysis + scoring modules,
                    with all examples analysed concurrently via asyncio.gather().

Prometheus metrics track queue depth, job counts, and processing durations.

Process flow position: started by main.lifespan() at startup; consumes from
job_queue which is populated by main.assess_document() and
main.assess_with_reference().
