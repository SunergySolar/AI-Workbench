"""Generate the classifier's manual document-test fixtures.

Run from anywhere; files are written next to this script:

    uv run --package classifier python unit-tests/classifier/documents/make_fixtures.py

Everything is generated rather than committed as opaque binaries, so a fixture
can be tuned (more skew, heavier blur, an extra page) by editing one constant
and re-running. Output is deterministic — the noise generators are seeded — so
re-running produces byte-comparable files and an unchanged git diff unless the
recipe itself changed.

Fixtures produced (see README.md for the criteria/expectations table):

    invoice_native.pdf        1-page PDF with a real text layer and a table
    invoice_scanned.pdf       the same invoice as a page IMAGE only (no text
                              layer), slightly rotated and noisy → needs OCR
    invoice_two_page.pdf      the invoice split over TWO pages, native text —
                              two ITEMS in one document. A sentence runs over
                              the page break ("Please remit the balance to" /
                              "the Acme Roofing billing office."), so a text
                              criterion with options.scope "document" finds
                              it and a page-scope one does not
    contract.txt              plain UTF-8 text, "Limited Warranty" + a date
    proposal.docx             headings, paragraphs, and a table row
                              "System Size | 8.4 kW"
    photo_of_letter.png       a letter photographed badly: ~3° skew, uneven
                              brightness, mild blur, sensor noise → OCR-able
    photo_of_letter_blurry.png  same letter, heavily blurred → sharpness FAILs
                              and OCR confidence drops
    unsupported_legacy.doc    the OLE2 magic plus padding, to demonstrate the
                              clear "convert to .docx" rejection
    diagram.svg               a roof-plan drawing as SVG: <text> labels (a
                              native text layer), shapes, one embedded data:
                              PNG (drawn) and one external <image> link
                              (never drawn — a documents[].warnings line, or
                              a fetch attempt with CLASSIFIER_SVG_FETCH_IMAGES)

The letter both photo fixtures are made from also carries three non-text
marks — a company logo, a "RECEIVED" stamp, and a signature — so a presence
criterion ("has a company logo") has something real to find and a known box
to be checked against. They are drawn from fixed constants, never from the
RNG, so adding them did not move the noise stream of any other fixture; see
``LOGO_BOX`` / ``STAMP_CENTER`` / ``SIGNATURE_BOX`` below and the README's
"Marks on the letter" table.

Dependencies: pymupdf, python-docx, pillow, numpy — all already in
ai/classifier/pyproject.toml.

2. Limited Warranty. Contractor provides a Limited Warranty covering
workmanship for ten (10) years from the date of substantial completion.
Manufacturer warranties on materials pass through to the Owner and are not
extended by this section. The Limited Warranty is void if the roof is
modified by anyone other than Contractor.
