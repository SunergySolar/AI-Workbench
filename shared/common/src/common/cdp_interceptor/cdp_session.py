    Parameters
    ----------
    debug_port : int
        Chrome remote-debugging port.
    interceptor_script : str
        JS source injected into the target tab (already prefixed with
        ``const DEBUG_LOGGING = ...;`` by the caller).
    target_url : str
        URL the caller wants Chrome to be at. If Chrome is currently on a
        login page, we wait; otherwise we navigate/reload to this URL.
    parse_fn, on_data, on_capture, on_status
        Callbacks. ``on_capture`` fires for every capture (unfiltered).
        ``parse_fn`` is invoked only on URL-pattern-matched captures.
        ``on_data`` fires when ``parse_fn`` returns a truthy dict (or on
        every url_pattern match when ``parse_fn`` is None, with the raw body).
    reload_event : threading.Event
        Caller sets this to request a live-loop page reload.
    stop_event : threading.Event
        Caller sets this to request clean shutdown.
    url_patterns : list[re.Pattern] | None
        When set, only captures whose URL matches at least one pattern reach
        ``parse_fn`` / ``on_data``. Non-matching captures still fire ``on_capture``.
    login_url_keywords : tuple[str, ...]
        Substrings in ``location.href`` that indicate a login page.
    tab_url_hint : str
        Substring used to prefer a specific existing tab when Chrome has
        multiple pages open. Empty = pick any ``type=="page"`` tab.
    on_login_wall : callable | None
        Called (no arguments, on this thread) the FIRST time per session that
        a login wall is detected — right after ``on_status("waiting_login")``
        and before the wait for the login to resolve. It may block (e.g. run
        login steps over a second CDP connection); the ``login_timeout`` wait
        starts when it returns. Exceptions are logged and swallowed.
