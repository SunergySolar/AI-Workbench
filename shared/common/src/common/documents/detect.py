"""Format detection by content, not by filename or Content-Type header.

Any caller can upload ``invoice.pdf`` with ``Content-Type: image/png``, so the
bytes themselves are the only trustworthy signal. ``detect_kind`` sniffs magic
signatures first and only falls back to a structural check (ZIP directory for
.docx, decodability for .txt) when the leading bytes are ambiguous.

Supported kinds and how they are recognised:

    image  — JPEG ``FF D8 FF`` or PNG ``89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A``
    pdf    — ``%PDF-`` (allowing the leading junk some producers emit)
    docx   — ZIP magic ``PK\\x03\\x04`` whose central directory contains
             ``word/document.xml`` (an .xlsx/.pptx ZIP is therefore rejected)
    svg    — UTF-8 XML whose first element is ``<svg>`` (``svg.looks_like_svg``).
             Checked BEFORE txt: an SVG decodes as text too, and calling it
             txt would hand its markup to a text search and a vision model.
    txt    — decodes as UTF-8 (BOM tolerated), contains no NUL bytes, and is
             overwhelmingly printable

Anything else raises ``UnsupportedDocumentError``. Two near-misses get their
own message, because "unsupported file" is not a useful answer when the user
is holding the file: legacy ``.doc`` (OLE2 compound files, magic
``D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1``) is told to convert to .docx, and gzip data
(magic ``1F 8B`` — a ``.svgz`` in practice) is told to decompress to .svg.
``.svgz`` is refused rather than inflated on purpose: a few kilobytes of gzip
can expand to gigabytes, and supporting it would buy little.

Process flow position: called by ``loaders.load_document`` before dispatch;
services also call it directly to reject an upload before queueing work.
