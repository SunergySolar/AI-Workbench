"""
SqliteRegistry — async, aiosqlite-backed, persistent job tracking.

Kickoff-then-poll shape (no context manager): the caller registers a job,
stores the returned ``job_id``, then updates phase / result / error at
distinct points in time from wherever it likes. Jobs survive process
restarts; they only leave the store on an explicit ``delete()`` call or the
consumer's own retention policy.

This is the right shape for services that hand off work to a background
worker and expose ``POST kickoff → GET /jobs/{id}`` polling: the kickoff
endpoint returns immediately with a ``job_id`` while the actual work happens
in an asyncio task. A service whose job rows must be queryable from outside
the process (``psql``, Trino) wants ``PostgresRegistry`` instead.

The table doubles as a durable FIFO work queue: producers register jobs in
``"pending"`` and any number of consumers call ``claim_next()`` to
atomically take the oldest one. ``reset_phase("processing", "pending")`` at
startup recovers jobs a crashed process left half-done. See
``common.jobs.worker.WorkerPool`` for the reference consumer.

Optional dep: ``aiosqlite``. If a consumer imports this module without
having aiosqlite installed, they get a clean ``ImportError`` at import time.
